# Keyword map — one primary query per page

Anti-cannibalization contract: every indexable page owns ONE primary query
family. Before adding or retitling a page, check this map — if the query is
taken, strengthen that page instead of competing with it. Titles are unique
sitewide (enforced by tests/unit/seo-content.test.ts).

## Rules

1. City-qualified transactional queries ("X The Woodlands") belong to
   `/the-woodlands/*` pages — never to `/services/*` titles.
2. Blog posts take informational phrasings ("how much does…", "what is…") and
   always link to the transactional page that owns the money query.
3. New cities repeat this pattern: hub `/<city>`, spokes `/<city>/<service>`,
   villages `/<city>/<neighborhood>` — gated by quality-gate.ts until content
   is real and distinct.
4. Facts on any page must trace to docs/research-facts.md (or a new sourced
   entry added there first).
